# Women Do Better in Sports

This project explores how the performance gap between men and women has evolved across time in different sports disciplines, with a special focus on **world records** and moments where **women's records cross past men's records** ("glass ceiling" effect).

The project is part of my Master's Thesis and aims to produce:

- An **interactive Streamlit app** to explore records, predictions, and gender gaps.
- A **storytelling landing page** with scrollytelling visuals (for portfolio / competitions such as *Information is Beautiful*).

## 🔍 Core idea

For each discipline (e.g. 100m sprint):

- Plot the **historical progression of men's and women's world records** (time or distance).
- Highlight the **crossover moment**:  
  when the **current women's record** is **faster/better than all men's records before a certain year**.
- Extend the curves into the **future** using prediction models (ML/DL)  
  – shown as dashed lines or uncertainty bands to distinguish them from observed data.

This allows statements like:

> "Before **1930**, no man had ever run as fast as the **current women’s 100m world record**."
